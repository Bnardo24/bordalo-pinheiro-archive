      <h1>Fish</h1>
      
      <p>In Portugal fish, especially the sardine, have been an important part of Portuguese culture and cuisine for centuries. Considering the fact Portugal is a coastal country bordering the Atlantic sea and coincidentally home to the farthest western point in Europe, fishing has always been a thriving industry that's fed the population and kept the country going even through tough economic situations. Itâ€™s a fish that became a staple of the Portuguese menu and can be commonly found at every restaurant and even sold grilled fresh in beach cities. Bordalo Pinheiro as an enjoyer of good food took this simple and iconic fish and made it an empty ceramic canvas that he filled with culturally prominent patterns and imagery such as the traditional tiles. This ceramic sardine can often be found in peoples kitchens and scattered around restaurants all over the country. People love this symbol so much that every year in Lisbon there is a graphic design competition that thousands of people enter to create a sardine that represents the year.
