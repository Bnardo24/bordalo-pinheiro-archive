    <h1>Cabbage</h1>
    
    <p>In Portugal everyone knows and most likely owns a piece of Bordalo Pinheiro ceramics. If there were a poll on which is the most commonly owned, the cabbage would undoubtedly come out on top. The cabbage was the first ceramic design that Bordalo Pinheiro came up with. It was an instant success in the commercial market being replicated thousands of times, always handmade in his factory. It even reached success in the United States, and the United Kingdom going on to win multiple awards for it’s design. This was before Portugal fell into dictatorship, and the trade borders were inevitably closed. The cabbage became a symbol of joy, and creativity inspiring many other artists to either join Bordalo Pinheiro in creating his vision, or coming up with their own unique designs. It’s a staple of Portuguese culture that can be found internationally. There’s even devoted collectors that buy imperfect pieces to add to their vast collection.  </p>
